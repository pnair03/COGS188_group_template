Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",
